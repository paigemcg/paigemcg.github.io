        After getting cheated on by her long term boyfriend, Jess Day quickly moves into a Los Angeles loft with three random men. Nick Miller, one of the roommates, is a bartender and aspiring writer who dropped out of law school. Another one of the roommates, Schmidt (name later revealed to be Winston Schidmt) works at a marketing firm and is uptight and considers himself to be a ladies man. The final roommate is Winston Bishop who is Nick's childhood friend that is just returning from playing professional basketball oversees. In the pilot the third roommate was a character called Coach, but he had to be replaced as there was contractual conflict with the actor playing Coach.
