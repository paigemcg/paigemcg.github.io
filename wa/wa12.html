        <h1>What I've done</h1>
        <p>So this came together through a lot of suffering, perseverance, and more suffering. Through much trial and error I found a simple API that I could use to just pull some new funfacts about dogs. Then I brought in a new second API that would load random photos of dogs. This caused more pain because getting the images to load and not just the url of the image was no fun, but I figured it out eventually (not sure I figured anything out but it seems to work now so). And that is what you missed on Glee. </p>
